          Hey I'm an independant strong woman who has nothing to prove! living life loud and proud! recently came into possession of a baby! Having a lot of fun with that! seriously these things love sweets. Ron expects me to nurse it but honestly that ship sailed awhile ago, besides I'm not feeling Ron he's perfect and not angry like all my other boyfriends but I'm not sure if I want a slow life. We <em>have</em> been dating for six months, a personal best.</p>
